# CSSA Guides System Documentation

**All pieces of code related to the guide system were originally authored by [Peter Vu](https://github.com/pieberrykinnie). Most of the code (and the documentation) was generated by Cursor AI with Claude 3.7 Sonnet. There might be some tech debt lying around, but optimizations have been implemented where appropriate (e.g. lazy loading for images, which was a custom solution that OG mdx didn't have). If you're a future executive of the CSSA and decided that all of this is gibberish and should be abandoned, no hard feelings; the new features were designed to be as self-contained as possible, aside from mandatory packages that had to be installed. Regardless, I hope you see the value in having this kind of system implemented in this way on the website!**

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the CSSA Website Guides system.

## About the Guides System

The Guides system is a dynamic content platform built for the CSSA website that allows for the creation and management of educational guides using Markdown files. It provides a structured, maintainable way to deliver content to users while supporting features like syntax highlighting, navigation, and responsive design.

## Key Features

- File-based content management (no database required)
- Dynamic guide and section rendering
- Automatic navigation and table of contents
- Responsive design for all devices
- Support for code syntax highlighting
- Image embedding and optimization

## Getting Started

If you're new to the system, start with the [Index](./index.md) document, which provides an overview of all available documentation. From there, you can explore specific areas of interest based on your needs.

To add a new guide, refer to the [Guide Creation](./guide-creation.md) document for detailed instructions.

## Technology Stack

The Guides system is built on:

- Next.js 14 App Router
- TypeScript
- Markdown processing with remark/rehype
- Tailwind CSS for styling

## Maintenance

This documentation should be updated whenever significant changes are made to the Guides system. If you modify any aspects of the system's architecture, components, or API, please update the relevant documentation files to keep them in sync with the implementation.
